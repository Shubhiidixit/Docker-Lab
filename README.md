# Docker Lab

Welcome to the Docker Labs repository! This repository contains a collection of Docker labs and exercises to help you learn and practice using Docker for containerization, from the basics of container creation to more advanced topics like orchestration. Each lab is designed to guide you through specific Docker tasks and scenarios, allowing you to gain hands-on experience with containerization.

# Prerequisites
Make sure you have the software installed on your system:
Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Introduction to Docker

**Docker** is an open-source containerization platform that simplifies the process of building, deploying, and managing applications. It is based on the concept of containers, which are self-contained, isolated environments that package an application and its dependencies, allowing it to run consistently across different environments.

Docker provides the following key benefits:

- **Portability:** Docker containers can run on any system that supports Docker, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This ensures that your applications work consistently in development, testing, and production environments.

- **Isolation:** Containers provide process and file system isolation, allowing multiple applications to run on the same host without interfering with each other.

- **Efficiency:** Docker containers are lightweight and consume fewer resources than traditional virtual machines, making them efficient for deploying and scaling applications.

- **Version Control:** Docker images, which serve as the blueprints for containers, can be versioned and stored in repositories. This enables version control and easy sharing of application configurations.

- **Orchestration:** Docker can be integrated with orchestration tools like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm for managing and scaling containerized applications in a cluster.
